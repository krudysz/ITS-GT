&lt;tt&gt;abs(zz), phase(zz)&lt;/tt&gt;
</answer1>
		<reason1>
NOTE: The best answer is angle(), because phase() is NOT available in most installations of MATLAB.  It happens to be available in some ECE MATLAB installations which have a toolbox called the Identification Toolbox.  In addition, there are some situations where phase() will compute an answer that is different from the one computed by angle().

&amp;Psi;(&lt;TT&gt;t&lt;/TT&gt;) is the instantaneous frequency.
</answer1>
		<reason1>
&amp;Psi;(&lt;TT&gt;t&lt;/TT&gt;) is the time-varying phase, not the instantaneous frequency.
</reason1>
		<weight2>0</weight2>
		<answer2>
The instantaneous frequency is always 1/(2&amp;pi;) times the coefficient of &lt;TT&gt;t&lt;/TT&gt;
</answer2>
		<reason2>
This is only true if &amp;Psi;(&lt;TT&gt;t&lt;/TT&gt;) is linear, not quadratic.
</reason2>
		<weight3>100</weight3>
		<answer3>
The instantaneous frequency is 1/(2&amp;pi;) times the derivative of the &quot;angle&quot; function &amp;Psi;(&lt;TT&gt;t&lt;/TT&gt;)
</answer3>
		<reason3>
CORRECT
</reason3>
		<weight4>0</weight4>
		<answer4>
The instantaneous frequency is 1/(2&amp;pi;) times the integral of the &quot;angle&quot; function &amp;Psi;(&lt;TT&gt;t&lt;/TT&gt;).
